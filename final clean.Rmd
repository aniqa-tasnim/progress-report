## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(tm)
library(SnowballC)
library(wordcloud)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
